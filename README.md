# Watcher.DeviceApi
Simplifies and abstracts the activation of devices from a single unified API endpoint.

I use this API in my custom security system to activate a device upon an alert being detected from my security cameras. The device can be a light, or smart power point, which can really have anything plugged into it (e.g. a radio).

The API optionally allows the device to be turned on for only a specified duration, or to be only turned on when after dark.
